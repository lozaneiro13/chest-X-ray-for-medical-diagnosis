# Medical Image Classification with CNNs

Automated chest X-ray diagnosis using deep learning and traditional machine learning models.

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive medical image classification system that:
- Downloads and preprocesses NIH Chest X-ray dataset
- Trains CNN and traditional ML models for binary classification (Normal vs Abnormal)
- Provides a web interface for real-time predictions
- Includes hyperparameter optimization and model comparison

## Dataset

**NIH Chest X-ray Dataset**
- 5,000+ preprocessed images
- Binary classification: Normal vs Abnormal findings
- Patient demographics and metadata included

## Models Implemented

### Deep Learning
- **CNN**: Custom architecture with Conv2D layers, dropout, and dense layers

### Traditional ML
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble method with HOG/LBP features
- **SVM**: Support Vector Machine with RBF kernel
- **Logistic Regression**: Linear classifier
- **K-Nearest Neighbors**: Distance-based classifier
- **Neural Network**: Multi-layer perceptron
